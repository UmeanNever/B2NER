# B2NER
 - Official Repo for Paper "Beyond Boundaries: Learning Universal Entity Taxonomy across Datasets and Languages for Open Named Entity Recognition"
 - The B2NERD dataset is released below for early usage. Our codes and models are on the way. (ETA 06/30)

# Data
One of the paper's core contribution is the cohesive and efficient B2NERD dataset, which is refined from 54 English and Chinese datasets.  
We provide 3 versions of our dataset.  
 - **B2NERD**: Contain ~52k samples from 54 datasets. The final version of our dataset suitable for out-of-domain / zero-shot NER model training. It has standardized entity definitions and pruned diverse data.   
 - B2NERD_all: Contain ~1.4M samples from 54 datasets. The full samples version of our dataset suitable for in-domain supervised evaluation. It has standardized entity definitions but does not go through any data selection or pruning.  
 - B2NERD_raw: Raw collected datasets and raw entity labels. With basic format preprocessing but without further standardization.

You can download the data from [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/11Wt4RU48i06OruRca2q_MsgpylzNDdjN/view?usp=drive_link).  
Please make sure you have got proper license to access the raw datasets.

# Implementation
